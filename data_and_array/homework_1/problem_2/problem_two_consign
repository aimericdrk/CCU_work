In Shadowverse, you will use a deck focusing on the Fairy and Beetle combo
strategy. Given an initial set of cards in hand and the available PP (play points),
you must simulate a single turn of play to maximize the total attack power of
all fairies on the field. Play one card at a time until the player gains the maximum
total attack power. When a card is played, the current PP is reduced by its cost.
Meanwhile, the initial attack power is set to 1 when a Fairy is played.
Each card in hand is represented by an object with the following properties:

⚫ Type: "F" (Fairy) or "B" (Beetle).
⚫ Cost: The PP required to play the card (an integer from 1 to 5).
⚫ Effect:
"0": No effect (for the card with Type = F, that is for Fairy only).
"1": Add one Fairy card (Cost = 1, Effect = "0") to your hand (for the card with
Type = B, that is for Beetle only).
"2": For each Fairiy currently on the field, gain 1 attack power (for the card
with Type B, that is for Beetle only). For example, if there are three fairies on
the field, the attack power increases by three.

Rules:
When a Fairy is played and the number of Fairies on the field is below the limit
which is set to 5 (Fairy limit on the field = 5 for all test cases), it is placed on the
field with an initial attack power of 1. When a Bettle is playced, a Beetle’s effect
is triggered immediately upon being played. You have PP for the turn, and you
may choose to play any sequence of cards, as long as the total PP spent does
not exceed the current available PP. Finally, determine the maximum possible
total attack power of all Fairies on the field after the turn, given the available PP,
initial cards, and card effects.

For example, given number of cards (N for short), and the available PP (P for
short), the details of computing the maximum attack power are shown here.
N = 4, P = 5

Cards:
1. F 1 0 (Fairy, cost=1, no effect)
2. F 1 0 (Fairy, cost=1, no effect)
3. B 2 1 (Beetle, cost=2, add one Fairy to hand)
4. B 3 2 (Beetle, cost=3, buff all Fairies on field +1 attack)

Enumerating possible sequences:
Plan A: Play 2 Fairies → Buff
Play Fairy (cost 1) → field [1], PP = 4.
Play Fairy (cost 1) → field [1, 1], PP = 3.
Play Beetle buff (cost 3) → both Fairies get +1 → field [2, 2], PP = 0.
The maximum total attack = 4

Plan B: Play 2 Fairies → Beetle add → Extra Fairy
Play Fairy (1) → field [1], PP = 4.
Play Fairy (1) → field [1, 1], PP = 3.
Play Beetle add (2) → +1 Fairy to hand, PP = 1.
Play new Fairy (1) → field [1, 1, 1], PP = 0.
The maximum total attack = 3

Plan C: Beetle add first → Fairies
Play Beetle add (2) → +1 Fairy to hand, PP = 3, field empty.
Play Fairy (1) → field [1], PP = 2.
Play Fairy (1) → field [1, 1], PP = 1.
Play Fairy (1) → field [1, 1, 1], PP = 0
The maximum total attack = 3

Plan D: Beetle buff first → Fairies
Play Beetle buff (3) → field empty, no effect, PP = 2.
Play Fairy (1) → field [1], PP = 1.
Play Fairy (1) → field [1, 1], PP = 0.
The maximum total attack = 2

Plan E: Beetle buff + Beetle add
Play Beetle buff (3) → no Fairies, PP = 2.
Play Beetle add (2) → +1 Fairy to hand, PP = 0.
Cannot play anything else, board empty.
The maximum total attack = 0
Among all possibilities, the best is Plan A, yielding a maximum total Fairy attack
of 4

Input
The first line contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), denoting the number of test
cases. Each test case consists of the following detials:
⚫ The first line contains two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10) and P (1 ≤ P ≤ 10),
representing the number of cards in hand and the available Play Points
(PP), respectively.
⚫ The next N lines each contain three fields:
 A character type ("F" or "B"), representing the card type.
 An integer cost (1 ≤ cost ≤ 5), representing the card’s cost.
 An integer effect (0 ≤ effect ≤ 2), representing the card’s effect.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer which is the
maximum total attack power of all Fairies on the board within the given PP limit.

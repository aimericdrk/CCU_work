Given an array X that stores a set of positive integers, please write a
program to find the maximum remainder obtained by dividing the sums of
subarrays of one-dimensional array X by a given divisor d . For example, we
have the array X = [2, 1, 3, 4] , and there are totally 10 subarrays, namely [2],
[2, 1], [2, 1, 3], [2, 1, 3, 4], [1], [1, 3], [1, 3, 4], [3], [3, 4], [4].
The subarray sums are: 2, 2 + 1 = 3, 2 + 1 + 3 = 6, 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 10, 1, 1 + 3
= 4, 1 + 3 + 4 = 8, 3, 3 + 4 = 7, and 4, respecively.
When the divisor is 5, the remainders are 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 4, 3, 3, 2, and 4,
respectively. The maximum remainder value among these remainders is 4,
which would be from subarrays [1, 3] and [4].

Input
The first line of input contains an integer n, indicating the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains an integer s,1<=s<=50000, which is
the size of the one-dimensional array X .The second line contains s positive
integers, indicating the elements of array X, where each integer i satisfies 0<=
i <= 99999.The last line contains an integer d, 1<=d<=1000, representing the
divisor.

Output
For each test case, output an integer on a single line, indicating the number of
subarrays with the maximum remainder value.
